I ride my horse every Sunday
People ride horses.
Horse riding is a sport.
Horses are too tall and they pretend to care about your feelings
Do they bite?

they pretend to care about your feelings, those horses
horses?

The horse stood still.
The boxes were heavy, so carrying two of them was too much weight to handle.
Katie asked her about the progress on the horse ranch.

The horse stumbled, and his rider was thrown heavily to the ground.
51 
8 
 
As she swung into the saddle, the horse sidestepped.
53 
15 
 
His horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and Petya fell heavily on to the wet ground.
34 
13 
 
He's a big horse, but I couldn't make him carry the two of us in that terrain.
32 
15 
 
He walked back to his horse and untied something from the saddle.
32 
17 
 
He had nearly finished this last task when a low growling was suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously with his heels.
27 
14 
 
He got down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big warm hands.
17 
5 
 
The horse was lamed on a rock.
32 
20 
 
The wounded leg soon became so much worse that the horse was suspended from a beam.

A horse and rider could cover more distance in a day that the mules could pulling the heavy freight wagons.
16 
7 
 
The cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful.
21 
12 
 
The night was getting chilly and the warmth from the horse was welcome.
14 
6 
 
Gently disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop.
8 
 
 
He turned to his horse and mounted in one smooth movement.
13

Alex pointed at a white horse prancing along the fence.
11 
5 
 
He swung up on his horse and tipped his hat to her before riding into the desert.
10 
4 
 
The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly's tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and approached Bolkonski with a slight bow.
7 
1 
 
As soon as I see the light, I will mount my horse and ride out to give the alarm.
8 
3 
 
Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpatych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs.
5 
1 
 
He turned and mounted his horse in one lithe movement.

5 
 
We came home in horse cars because it was Sunday and steam cars do not go often on Sunday.
6 
3 
 
There was a hopeless look in the dull eye that I could not help noticing, and then, as I was thinking where I had seen that horse before, she looked full at me and said, 'Black Beauty, is that you?'
6 
3 
 
It plays house, as well as horse, having an instinct for it.
7 
4 
 
After all, the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages; he is not an evangelist, nor does he come round eating locusts and wild honey.
9 
6 
 
The rear end of the car danced sideways, bouncing like a horse kicking up its heels.
6 
4 
 
As she peered through the soft gray light not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away.
7 
5 
 
So he spurred his horse to ride to their aid.
9 
7 
 
The horse was an old, worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and bones that showed plainly through it; the knees knuckled over, and the forelegs were very unsteady.
7 
5 
 
Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon were everywhere.
2 
 
 
The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him.
2 
 
 
Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre, bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.
2 
 
 
As he turned the horse around, he eyed the men suspiciously.
4 
3 
 
Apparently the horse knew the rider meant business, because it didn't act up again.
5 
4 
 
"Never look a gift horse in the mouth," she quipped with a shrug.
4 
3 
 
She eyed the horse skeptically.
10 
9 
 
The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get his breath.
2 
1 
 
The horse cantered briskly along, and king and boy were soon quite well acquainted.
1 
 
 
"Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go--foot or horse--that I'll warrant," said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.
15 
14 
 
"Hey, Cossack, my horse!" he said.
1 
 
 
In the dark Petya recognized his own horse, which he called "Karabakh" though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.
2 
1 
 
"And fairness, of course," he added, "for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he can do no good either for himself or for me."
6 
5 
 
The men cheered as he turned the horse and rode it out of the corral.
5 
5 
 
Felipa kicked her horse into a lope and rode up beside him.
6 
6 
 
I had grand plans to build and run a large-scale horse ranch.
2 
2 
 
She gripped his waist as he turned the horse around and headed back toward the hacienda.
1 
1 
 
Anyway, I've never ridden a horse before.
6 
6 
 
Removing the bridle, he released the horse in the corral.
10 
10 
 
"Can your horse talk?" she asked.
1 
1 
 
This second one was a Rain of People-and-Horse-and-Buggy.
1 
1 
 
Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them, and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.
 
 
 
"What does all this mean, anyhow?" asked the horse, jumping to escape a thorn.
4 
4 
 
The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip.
1 
1 
 
The third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a fall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear, which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer.
3 
3 
 
"All right," answered the horse; "I'll do my best.
1 
1 
 
So the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flew away from the platform.
 
 
 
"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with no way of getting out?" enquired the horse, seriously.
 
 
 
She felt that Jim would know more about the Saw-Horse later on.
 
 
 
One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten in her lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and the boy were all that remained in the underground prison.
 
 
 
The cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to make sure he was not asleep.
 
 
 
"What's to become of me?" asked the horse, uneasily.
 
 
 
This mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maiden decided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big building having many rooms that were seldom in use.
 
 
 
So Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horse around to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he could have all to himself.
 
 
 
"Well, well!" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked.
 
 
 
Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.
 
 
 
I know I'm not much account; but I'm the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so they treat me with great respect.
 
 
 
"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?" he murmured.
 
 
 
"No; you miss many pleasures," remarked the cab-horse, pityingly.
 
 
 
The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf.
 
 
 
This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant King of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess Ozma.
 
 
 
"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?" asked the Sawhorse admiringly.
 
 
 
"He's a vegetarian," remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch the clover.
 
 
 
Jim and the buggy followed, the old cab-horse being driven by Zeb while the Wizard stood up on the seat and bowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of the people, who crowded thick about him.
 
 
 
"Once, when I was young," said Jim, "I was a race horse, and defeated all who dared run against me.
 
 
 
I only wish there was a real horse here for me to race with.
 
 
 
Its wooden legs moved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen, and although so much smaller than the cab-horse it covered the ground much faster.
 
 
 
He has won the race, and won it fairly; but what can a horse of flesh do against a tireless beast of wood?
 
 
 
"I ought to be a fairy," grumbled Jim, as he slowly drew the buggy home; "for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of no account whatever.
 
 
 
They could not see the speeding horse, but they heard the clatter of its hoofs far down the road, and they understood the cry, "Up! up! and defend yourselves!"
1 
1 
 
So he quickly finished the shoeing, and the groom hurried to lead the horse to the king.
1 
1 
 
But there was no horse for him.
 
 
 
For the want of a nail the shoe was lost; For the want of a shoe the horse was lost; For the want of a horse the battle was lost; For the failure of battle the kingdom was lost;-- And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
 
 
 
He was riding very slowly, and both he and his horse were bespattered with mud.
 
 
 
Then, without another word, he mounted his brother's little farm horse and rode away.
 
 
 
One was Mr. Webster's horse; the other was an old gray nag with a lady's sidesaddle on its back.
 
 
 
Mount your horse, and my own men will ride with you and see that you reach the end of your journey in safety.
 
 
 
His horse was led to the door, and a servant helped him to mount it.
 
 
 
He turned his horse and rode away.
 
 
 
Both he and his family dressed well; they had plenty to eat; he had even bought a horse to help him carry his produce to market.
 
 
 
One person with a horse and a cotton gin could process as much as fifty people without the gin.

However, I should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work he might do for me, for fear I should become a horseman or a herdsman merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we certain that what is one man's gain is not another's loss, and that the stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied?
 
 
 
That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks!
 
 
 
That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks!
 
 
 
One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired concerning Wyman the younger.
 
 
 
But presently the traveller's horse sank in up to the girths, and he observed to the boy, "I thought you said that this bog had a hard bottom."
 
 
 
The regimental commander sought out Dolokhov in the ranks and, reining in his horse, said to him:
 
 
 
"My dear fellow, how are you?" said he through the singing, making his horse keep pace with the company.
 
 
 
Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.
 
 
 
Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's head.
 
 
 
(Rook was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov.)
 
 
 
"Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answered Rostov, though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum.
 
 
 
And it's a horse you'll thank me for.
 
 
 
"Have you told them to bring the horse?" asked Telyanin, getting up and looking carelessly about him.
 
 
 
"I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse," said Telyanin.
 
 
 
The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and Rostov, without returning home, took a horse and rode there.
 
 
 
Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin's horse at the porch.
 
 
 
The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy's horse patrols could be discerned.
 
 
 
Halfway across stood Prince Nesvitski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings.
 
 
 
With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting continually he moved on.
 
 
 
"Don't kick up the dust, you infantry!" jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.
 
 
 
"Take a stick between your legs, that'll suit you for a horse!" the hussar shouted back.
 
 
 
Look at me, cried Denisov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.
 
 
 
With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols.
 
 
 
After him the stout Nesvitski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.
 
 
 
His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly's charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud.
 
 
 
"At boss zides, Captain," he heard the voice of the colonel, who, having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face.
 
 
 
His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet.
 
 
 
Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander-in-chief and of his own luggage.
 
 
 
Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a caleche.
 
 
 
Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery, looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball.
 
 
 
Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagration.
 
 
 
Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagration reined in his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him.
 
 
 
However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction of Tushin's battery.
 
 
 
Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, the prince's personal adjutant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian--an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity.
 
 
 
The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.
 
 
 
He reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak.
 
 
 
Zherkov, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about and galloped off.
 
 
 
The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the Pavlograd commander.
 
 
 
"Quite avare, your excellency," suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his horse and turning purple in the face.
 
 
 
No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.
 
 
 
He was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.
 
 
 
He turned his horse and galloped off.
 
 
 
The first thing he saw on riding up to the space where Tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.
 
 
 
After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing: What did he say?
 
 
 
Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards? asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.
 
 
 
The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.
 
 
 
He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood.
 
 
 
He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode home.
 
 
 
Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonski, sitting his horse indolently and carelessly.
 
 
 
Rostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face "like a vewy devil," as Denisov expressed it.
 
 
 
One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had taken from the prisoner.
 
 
 
And at every word he added: "But don't hurt my little horse!" and stroked the animal.
 
 
 
The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostov, being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.
 
 
 
"But don't hurt my little horse!" said the Alsatian good-naturedly to Rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar.
 
 
 
Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on.
 
 
 
Rostov saw how the Emperor's rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse's side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir.
 
 
 
He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart.
 
 
 
He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars.
 
 
 
His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts.
 
 
 
Rostov's horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground, pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights.
 
 
 
Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came.
 
 
 
Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside.
 
 
 
Rostov turned his horse and galloped back.
 
 
 
Rostov reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace.
 
 
 
Only when approaching Bagration did Rostov let his horse gallop again, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.
 
 
 
Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals.
 
 
 
One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one.
 
 
 
He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own.
 
 
 
The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner.
 
 
 
He touched his horse and having called Miloradovich, the commander of the column, gave him the order to advance.
 
 
 
Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the Emperor.
 
 
 
The Emperor's horse started at the sudden cry.
 
 
 
My turn has come, thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutuzov.
 
 
 
"Stop them!" he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.
 
 
 
Another in the same place turned round and fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutuzov himself rode.
 
 
 
But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard.
 
 
 
The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and happiness.
 
 
 
On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line.
 
 
 
They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.
 
 
 
The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.
 
 
 
Rostov, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.
 
 
 
Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostov before he heard them shout, "Hurrah!" and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French.
 
 
 
At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent.
 
 
 
This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves.
 
 
 
Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostov, to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard.
 
 
 
He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but the farther he went the more disorganized they were.
 
 
 
Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him.
 
 
 
Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded officer passing by addressed him:
 
 
 
Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same.
 
 
 
It flopped into something moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood.
 
 
 
The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts: Onto the ice, why do you stop?
 
 
 
Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of the Horse Guards.
 
 
 
"You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander's regiment of Horse Guards?" asked Napoleon.
 
 
 
Au revoir, Prince Repnin! and he spurred his horse and galloped away.
 
 
 
He remembered the expression Dolokhov's face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a post-boy's horse with a pistol.
 
 
 
Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Denisov's short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be.
 
 
 
"Go to the devil! quick ma'ch, while you're safe and sound!" and Denisov turned his horse on the officer.
 
 
 
"Very well, very well!" muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.
 
 
 
Stopping beside his horse, with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:
 
 
 
He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth.
 
 
 
"That is Bezukhova's brother, Anatole Kuragin," she said, indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies.
 
 
 
Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human life.
 
 
 
The old count's horse, a sorrel gelding called Viflyanka, was led by the groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.
 
 
 
The whine of a straggling hound could be heard.
 
 
 
"A good thing too, little countess," said "Uncle," "only mind you don't fall off your horse," he added, "because--that's it, come on!--you've nothing to hold on to."
 
 
 
Having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed, and comfortable horse, Viflyanka, which was turning gray, like himself.
 
 
 
And how well he looks on his horse, eh?
 
 
 
Leaped a fearful place; what a sight when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price!
 
 
 
The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and Daniel's chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat.
 
 
 
He saw Karay seize the wolf, and checked his horse, supposing the affair to be over.
 
 
 
Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail.
 
 
 
Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse, accompanied by two hunt servants.
 
 
 
For a long time they continued to look at red Rugay who, his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind "Uncle's" horse with the serene air of a conqueror.
 
 
 
"Uncle" lifted Natasha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch.
 
 
 
Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the old count's with a trotter from the Orlov stud as shaft horse, the fourth was Nicholas' own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.
 
 
 
The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar, and threw it up.
 
 
 
The near side horse, arching his head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his traces.
 
 
 
The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears as if asking: "Isn't it time to begin now?"

He had ruined more than one horse in their service.
1 
1 
 
On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was brought to Napoleon.
1 
1 
 
In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor's eyes.
 
 
 
He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest part where the current was swift.
 
 
 
He called for his horse and rode to his quarters.
 
 
 
A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied by two hussars.
 
 
 
In front of the group, on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders.
 
 
 
He laid his hand on the withers of Balashev's horse and said:
 
 
 
Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan.
 
 
 
A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donets horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could outgallop him.
 
 
 
To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor's wife, but not once of the impending danger.
 
 
 
Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following him.
 
 
 
The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself.
 
 
 
He touched his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.
 
 
 
With the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostov gave rein to his Donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons' disordered lines.
 
 
 
One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars.
 
 
 
Rostov, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after him.
 
 
 
On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected.
 
 
 
That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber.
 
 
 
In another moment Rostov's horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer's horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant Rostov, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.
 
 
 
The officer fell, not so much from the blow--which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow--as from the shock to his horse and from fright.
 
 
 
Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished.
 
 
 
On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse.
 
 
 
If they call up the militia, you too will have to mount a horse, remarked the old count, addressing Pierre.
 
 
 
How could they make a man commander-in-chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals!
 
 
 
Kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard's cap with a red band and no peak, nodding his head continually.
 
 
 
Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments....
 
 
 
But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.
 
 
 
His horse lagged behind the adjutant's and jolted him at every step.
 
 
 
Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which Berthier had aroused him.
 
 
 
"At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard destroyed!" he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevardino.
 
 
 
The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.
 
 
 
The horse first, regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the major, and galloped aside.
 
 
 
And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness, and again--as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself--he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.
 
 
 
The postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed.
 
 
 
Two officers, one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka Street, talking.
 
 
 
The officer mounted his horse and rode after him.
 
 
 
He indicated the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.
 
 
 
The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses.
 
 
 
That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers.
 
 
 
The Cossack's report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was the final proof that events had matured.
 
 
 
A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutuzov's orderly, pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to Ermolov's quarters.
 
 
 
The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Ermolov was often to be found.
 
 
 
The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.
 
 
 
"You think he went off just by chance?" said a comrade, who was on the staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to Ermolov.
 
 
 
He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering suggestions that they should attack.
 
 
 
There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown.
 
 
 
Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides.
 
 
 
Like his horse, which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him.
 
 
 
Denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his rider's knee against a tree.
 
 
 
"Oh, the devil!" exclaimed Denisov angrily, and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his comrades with mud.
 
 
 
And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the watchman's hut in the forest, and told the officer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and find out where Dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening.
 
 
 
"It won't hurt that devil--he's as strong as a horse!" they said of him.
 
 
 
After talking for some time with the esaul about next day's attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have definitely decided on, Denisov turned his horse and rode back.
 
 
 
Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.
 
 
 
The man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to Dolokhov's horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the landowner's house.
 
 
 
Dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a footpace.
 
 
 
Dolokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and vanished into the darkness.
 
 
 
His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and, turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode up to Denisov.

2 
 
At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Petya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov who shouted at him.

Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his plump little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back.

Then the horse bunched up under him.

We would not let him get on the horse with Destiny.

Jonathan said you were taking him to some kind of horse race tomorrow.
1 
2 
 
But the horse did not buck him off.
1 
2 
 
From there the horse dashed in and out of the poles and came to a stop on his haunches.
 
1 
 
Actually, everything belongs to both of us, but I was the one who had the lifelong dream of a horse ranch.
 
1 
 
After they left, Carmen sank into the chair and picked up a horse magazine.
 
1 
 
The only business experience she had was the goat dairy, the non-functional farm and a horse ranch that had been in the fetal stage for years.
 
1 
 
This make a good horse ranch, yes?
 
1 
 
Without another word, he turned the horse and kicked it into a trot in the opposite direction.
5 
6 
 
The horse lifted its head and nickered in the direction of the path.
 
1 
 
He reached under the horse and tightened the cinch, which finally brought Diablo to attention.
 
1 
 
Stepping around the horse, he disappeared down that mysterious pathway.
1 
2 
 
And yet, every time she saw him, he was on his horse, ATV or in his car.
1 
2 
 
He threw a saddle on a reddish brown horse and nodded You're right.
2 
3 
 
He turned his horse around.
1 
2 
 
Why don't you ride up here with me for a while and give your horse a rest?
 
1 
 
He gave the horse enough room to walk away from the wagon and then tied the rope to the wagon.
 
1 
 
Bordeaux sat on his horse, looking genuinely surprised at her reaction.
 
1 
 
Even your horse has better sense than you do.
 
1 
 
He retrieved his hat and quietly led his horse away.
 
1 
 
If I had a horse like you I wouldn't drag him out in this awful desert.
1 
2 
 
Horse and rider plunged down the side of the dune toward them.
 
1 
 
The pace increased until a horse leaped over the wagon tongue and into the circle.
 
1 
 
She walked toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its head hanging down almost to the ground.
1 
2 
 
It was a big horse, tall and bony, with long legs and large knees and feet.
 
1 
 
The horse did not stir.
 
1 
 
Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.
 
1 
 
"How is Uncle Henry?" she enquired, after a pause during which the horse continued to trot with long, regular strides.
 
1 
 
The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked thoughtful.
 
1 
 
The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock.
 
1 
 
Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the horse tipping also.
 
1 
 
"Those were the first words I ever said," called out the horse, who had overheard them, "and I can't explain why I happened to speak then.
1 
2 
 
"Of course," growled the horse, "and then we shall be sorry it happened."
 
1 
 
Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense.
 
1 
 
"Eureka weights only about half a pound," replied the horse, in a scornful tone, "while I weigh about half a ton."
 
1 
 
I'm as hungry as the horse is, and I want my milk.
 
1 
 
In this quake a big crack opened and we fell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose and came down with us.
 
1 
 
As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass city made way for them and formed a procession in their rear.
1 
2 
 
"A nice country this is," he grumbled, "where a respectable horse has to eat pink grass!"
 
1 
 
The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.
 
1 
 
The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.
 
1 
 
"All right," said the horse; "I'll do it."
3 
4 
 
The horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashes appeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely.
 
1 
 
Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drew them rapidly over the smooth water.
1 
2 
 
The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decide whether he meant it or not.
 
1 
 
In turn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined the Gargoyles with the same silent attention.
 
1 
 
The horse had especially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and strangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their first attack.
 
1 
 
The others picked themselves up from the ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for a moment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease.
 
1 
 
But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next time.
 
1 
 
Even the kitten gave a dreadfully shrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly.
 
1 
 
"Ha, ha!" chuckled the old cab-horse; "they're not 'Gurgles,' little maid; they're Gargoyles."
 
1 
 
"Which wings must I flop first?" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly.
 
1 
 
He walked up and down the river bank, leading his horse behind him; but he kept his eyes turned always toward the dim, dark spot which he knew was the old North Church.
 
1 
 
Like a bird let loose, his horse leaped forward.

She makes many mistakes, of course, twists words and phrases, puts the cart before the horse, and gets herself into hopeless tangles of nouns and verbs; but so does the hearing child.
 
1 
 
Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door.
1 
2 
 
Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking at Alpatych from the back of the crowd.
 
1 
 
"Well then," continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, "report to them as I have told you"; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.
 
1 
 
Kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard's cap with a red band and no peak, nodding his head continually.
 
1 
 
He was wearing the white Horse Guard's cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap.
 
1 
 
Petya held his horse by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order to mount.
1 
2 
 
When they had all ridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill.
1 
2 
 
Morino said this horse was gentle.
5

To me, a beautiful horse is one that looks friendly.
 
2 
 
Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin--the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women--and all with fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old prince's cold and stiffened hand.

You wanted the horse ranch?

Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the man to him.
 
5 
 
Rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyin; he let Lavrushka have another horse and took him along with him.
